# **⚡ Photon Intelligence | Where Data Science Meets Energy & Light**
This repository was created as part of my learning journey in DSCI 8133: Foundations of Data Science at Mississippi State University.
It serves as a starting point for exploring GitHub as a collaborative tool for managing and sharing data science projects.

## **🔮 Future Vision: Illuminating Data with Intelligence**
This repository is set to evolve into a hub of innovation where light, energy, and data science converge. Upcoming enhancements include:

✨ A Sample Data File – A structured dataset to fuel insightful analysis.
⚡ An Interactive Jupyter Notebook – Bringing data to life with visualizations, computations, and intelligent models.

Stay tuned as we illuminate new pathways in data-driven engineering! 🚀💡
