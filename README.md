# **Python-Experiments**
This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133, Foundations of Data Science at 
Mississippi State University.

## **Plan**
Future Plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a Jupyter notebook that will interact with the file. 

## **About Me**
Hello, my name is Ali Sotoodeh (Ah-lee Soh-too-deh). I am a *Ph.D. student* in Industrial Engineering, an Electrical Engineer/Designer, 
and an adjunct faculty member teaching CAD and **Machine Design** in Texas. My expertise lies in data-driven engineering solutions and electrical system design.

*My research explores the following:*
* bio-inspired design
* Industrial safety and systems
* computational modeling.

  Recent publications include studies on LED heat sink optimization and system safety analysis.

This GitHub serves as a platform to share projects, research, and technical work in engineering and data science. I welcome collaboration and knowledge exchange. ðŸš€
